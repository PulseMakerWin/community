# Poll: SparkLend Gnosis - Update xDAI Oracle Parameter - April 15, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Tuesday, April 15 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to updating the "Oracle" parameter for xDAI onto SparkLend on Gnosis.

* Oracle: Set to a fixed rate of 1 USD
* Oracle Provider: N/A

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/apr-4-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24033) for more information about this change.

A risk evaluation has been provided by BA Labs and can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/apr-4-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24033/6). 

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* xDAI oracle parameter will be updated via a future executive vote.
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in Spark Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
