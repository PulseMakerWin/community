# Poll: Adjust SparkLend D3M Parameters - March 11, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of SparkLend. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to using the SparkLend Direct Deposit DAI Module (D3M) with the listed parameters. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to making the following parameter changes to the SparkLend DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M):
* Increase the SparkLend D3M [Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#14-3-1-4-1-maximum-debt-ceiling-line-) by 1.25 billion DAI from 1.25 billion DAI to **2.5 billion DAI**.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These parameter changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
