# Poll: Decrease the WSTETH KFb Metaparameter - February 19, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Scope Facilitator. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 19 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:

- Decrease the WSTETH [`KFb` metaparameter](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#14-3-1-3-stability-fee-sf-) to **7.5%**.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-rate-system-iteration-1-adjusting-wsteth-asset-spread/23687) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- [MIP104 14.3.1.3.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#14-3-1-3-1a) will be edited to reflect the decrease of the WSTETH `KFb` metaparameter.
- The outcome of this poll will supersede the results of any other poll approved in the same weekly governance cycle, but only for the specific WSTETH KFb metaparameter. Other parameters modified by the other poll will remain unaffected.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
