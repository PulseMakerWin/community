### Poll: Add a HEX Vault Type

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition for a **HEX Vault Type**.

The proposed initial Risk Parameters for HEX are:

- Stability Fee: 6%
- Debt Ceiling: 20,000,000 DAI
- Liquidation Ratio: 130%
- Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI
- Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
- Bid Duration: 6 hours
- Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
- Liquidation Penalty: 13%
- Dust: 100 DAI

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days, starting from the scheduled launch date. The results may inform an Executive Vote to initialize the HEX vault type, which could go live depending on the poll results.
